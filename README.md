# Mock-Language-Interpreter
The goals of this project is implementing an interpreter for the mock language X.

Mock language X as a simplied version of Java. The interpreter is responsible for processing byte codes that are created from the source code files with the extension x.

The interpreter and the Virtual Machine will work together to run a program written in the Language X. The two sample programs are a recursive version of computing the nth Fibonacci number and recursively finding the factorial of a number. These files have the extension x.cod
